Description:
	Based on the famous "Monty Hall" problem, the player will attempt to earn a total of $1,000,000 by guessing 1 correct door out of 3 doors. 

	After the player chooses a door, an incorrect door will reveal to be false and the player is asked if they want to switch their pick or stay with their original pick.

	Each time the player "wins", they have an option to double their winnings by playing again 

	The player starts out with $10,000 and by default will spend $1,000 for each attempt although they are able to "bet" more prior to the first door being picked.

	If the player has less than $0 , they will lose and will restart back at $10,000. Once the player reaches $1,000,000 they are redirected to a victory screen. 

	Each door will have a number on it, players will click on the door in order to make their pick. After clicking on the door, one of the incorrect doors will disappear and a text bubble will appear 
	asking if they want to stay with their initial choice or switch their pick. Note that the correct door's location is randomized.
